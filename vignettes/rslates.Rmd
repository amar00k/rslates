Slates is a web based editor that allows easy creation of interactive R based notebooks. 

## Philosophy



## Target Users

Slates targets different levels of users in different ways. 

For *beginner* level users:

  * Allows *programming without code*.
  * Source code output allows learning by example
  
For *proficient* R users:

  * Speeds up simple tasks
  * Quickly create interactive, reusable notebooks

For *power users*:

  * Full access to the simple underlying meta-programming infrastructure
  * Create new reusable *slates* with a few lines of code without ever leaving the application
